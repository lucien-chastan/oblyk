        You could ask yourself if Oblyk may replace paper guidebook and in the meantime harm climbing spots development ?<br>
        Be sure to know that we asked yourself this question a lot. Answer is no, Oblyk can't replace a guidebook!<br>
        Guidebooks have essential information that we won't add in Oblyk<br><br>
        Buying a guidebook, it is helping passionate climbers who give a lot to maintain, develop, clean climbing spots where you will climb for free.
